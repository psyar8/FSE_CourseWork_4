# FSE_CourseWork_4

In this project we have developed JUnit tests for the code provided for the 3 classes- CompanyEmail, CompanyProject, and CompanyEmailSystem. We have build the tests based on the test plan that we previously created. We have documented the tests that we carried out and have stated whether the tests we performed have passed or failed. If a test has failed, we edited the code so that the test could pass. This is documented as change table in CompanyEmail.doc. 

### The folder contains the following files:
1. CompanyEmail.doc
1. CompanyEmail.java
1. CompanyEmail_UnitTests.java
1. ComapanyEmailProject.doc
1. ComapanyEmailProject.java
1. ComapanyEmailProject_UnitTests.java
1. CompanyEmailSystem.doc
1. CompanyEmailSystem.java
1. CompanyEmailSystem_UnitTests.java

Structure of Project
---------------------
### Comment structure
We have commented our JUnit tests in the following format.
    
	/* 
	 * Testing: functionName()
	 * Author: Author Name
	 * Co-Author: Co-Author Name
	 * Test ID: Test ID (see test table)
	 * Date Tested: Date
	 * Test Result: PASS/FAIL
	 */

### Test Naming Convention

We have a unique ID for all the tests that we carried out. In the documents we have a test table which contains the tests that we carried out for the different classes. Each test is assigned with a unique ID, which is referenced in teh JUnit files. All the tests for the CompanyEmail class has test ID's starting from 100. All the tests for the CompanyProject class has test ID's starting from 200. All the tests for the CompanyEmailSystem class has test ID's starting from 300.

* 100 level = CompanyEmail
* 200 level = CompanyProject
* 300 level = CompanyEmailSystem
